/**
 * The {@link DiscoveryService} is a service interface which each binding can
 * implement to provide an auto discovery process for one or more {@code Thing} s.
 * <p>
 * As an example, a typical discovery mechanism could scan the network for <i>UPnP</i> devices, if requested.
 * <p>
 * A {@link DiscoveryService} must be able to finish its discovery process without any user interaction.
 * <p>
 * <b>There are two different kind of executions:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Background discovery:</b> If this mode is enabled, the discovery process should run in the background as long
 * as this mode is not disabled again. Background discovery can be enabled and disabled and is configured through the
 * configuration admin. The implementation class that registers an OSGi service must define a PID and has to react on
 * configuration changes for it. See also {@link DiscoveryService#CONFIG_PROPERTY_BACKGROUND_DISCOVERY}.</li>
 * <li><b>Active scan:</b> If an active scan is triggered, the the service should try to actively query for new devices
 * and should report new results within the defined scan timeout. An active scan can be aborted.</li>
 * </ul>
