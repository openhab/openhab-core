 * There are situations when item states do not have any defined value.
 * This might be because they have not been initialized yet (never
 * received an state update so far) or because their state is ambiguous
 * (e.g. a dimmed light that is treated as a switch (ON/OFF) will have
 * an undefined state if it is dimmed to 50%).
