/**
 * The software utility Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer
 * operating systems. People who set up and maintain software environments use
 * cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at
 * fixed times, dates, or intervals. It typically automates system maintenance
 * or administration—though its general-purpose nature makes it useful for
 * things like connecting to the Internet and downloading email at regular
 * intervals.[1] The name cron comes from the Greek word for time, χρόνος
 * chronos.
 * <p>
 * The Unix Cron defines a syntax that is used by the Cron service. A user
 * should register a Cron service with the {@link CronJob#CRON} property. The
 * value is according to the {link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron}.

 * <h3>Asterisk ( * )</h3>
 * <p>
 * The asterisk indicates that the cron expression matches for all values of the
 * field. E.g., using an asterisk in the 4th field (month) indicates every
 * month.
 * <h3>Slash ( / )</h3>
 * <p>
 * Slashes describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the 1st field
 * (minutes) indicate the third minute of the hour and every 15 minutes
 * thereafter. The form "*\/..." is equivalent to the form "first-last/...",
 * that is, an increment over the largest possible range of the field.
 * <h3>Comma ( , )</h3>
 * <p>
 * Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using "MON,WED,FRI"
 * in the 5th field (day of week) means Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Hyphen
 * ( - ) Hyphens define ranges. For example, 2000-2010 indicates every year
 * between 2000 and 2010 AD, inclusive.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, you can use some fixed formats:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;yearly (or &#64;annually)  Run once a year at midnight on the morning of January 1                      0 0 1 1 *
 * &#64;monthly                Run once a month at midnight on the morning of the first day of the month    0 0 1 * *
 * &#64;weekly                 Run once a week at midnight on Sunday morning                                0 0 * * 0
 * &#64;daily                  Run once a day at midnight                                                   0 0 * * *
 * &#64;hourly                 Run once an hour at the beginning of the hour                                0 * * * *
 * &#64;reboot                 Run at startup                                                               &#64;reboot
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Please note that for the constants we follow the Java 8 Date & Time constants.
 * Major difference is the day number. In Quartz this is 0-6 for SAT-SUN while
 * here it is 1-7 for MON-SUN.
