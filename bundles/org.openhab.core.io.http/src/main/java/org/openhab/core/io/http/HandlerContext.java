/**
 * Handler context represents a present state of all handlers placed in execution chain.

 * called. Second is intended to break the chain and force handlers to process error and generate error response.
 *
 * When Handler decide to not call context by delegating further handler to get called via
 * {@link #execute(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)} nor {@link #error(Exception)} then chain is stopped.
 * By this simple way handlers can decide to hold processing and generate own response.
