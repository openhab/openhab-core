mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.clientID.description = An optional client ID used for this connection.
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.keepAlive.label = Keep-Alive
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.keepAlive.description = Keep-alive timer in seconds. A too frequent timer could conquest the network / spam the MQTT server, a too low value might risk that a broken connection is detected very late.
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.qos.label = Quality of Service
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.qos.description = The Quality of Service (QoS) level is an agreement between sender and receiver of a message regarding the guarantees of delivering a message.
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.qos.option.0 = At most once (best effort delivery "fire and forget")
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.qos.option.1 = At least once (guaranteed that a message will be delivered at least once)
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.qos.option.2 = Exactly once (guarantees that each message is received only once by the counterpart)
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.retainMessages.label = Retain Messages
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.retainMessages.description = Messages send by this connection are retained
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.lwtTopic.label = Last Will - Topic
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.lwtTopic.description = When the connection dies, the last-will is performed by the MQTT server. This is the last-will topic. It must be set to perform a last-will.
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.lwtMessage.label = Last Will - Message
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.lwtMessage.description = When the connection dies, the last-will is performed by the MQTT server. This is the last-will message. Can be empty.
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.lwtQos.label = Last Will - Quality of Service

mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.lwtRetain.label = Last Will - Retain Message
mqtt.config.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.lwtRetain.description = When the connection dies, the last-will is performed by the MQTT server. If retain message is checked, the message will be retained by the MQTT server.

service.mqtt.systemBrokerConnectionInstance.label = System MQTT Broker
