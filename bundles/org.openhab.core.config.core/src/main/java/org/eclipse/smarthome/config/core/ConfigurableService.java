 * {@link ConfigurableService#SERVICE_PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION_URI} set will be considered as a configurable service. The
 * properties {@link ConfigurableService#SERVICE_PROPERTY_LABEL} and
 * {@link ConfigurableService#SERVICE_PROPERTY_CATEGORY} are optional.
 *
 * <p>
 * The services are configured through the OSGi configuration admin. Therefore each service must provide a PID or a
 * component name service property if the configuration is done by declarative services. If the
 * {@link Constants#SERVICE_PID} property is not set the
 * {@link ComponentConstants#COMPONENT_NAME} property will be used as fallback.
