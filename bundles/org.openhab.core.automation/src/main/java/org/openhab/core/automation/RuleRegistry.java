/**
 * The {@link RuleRegistry} provides basic functionality for managing {@link Rule}s.
 * It can be used to
 * <ul>
 * <li>Add Rules with the {@link Registry#add(Object)} method.</li>
 * <li>Get the existing rules with the {@link #getByTag(String)}, {@link #getByTags(String[])} methods.</li>
 * <li>Update the existing rules with the {@link Registry#update(Object)} method.</li>
 * <li>Remove Rules with the {@link Registry#remove(Object)} method.</li>
 * <li>Manage the state (<b>enabled</b> or <b>disabled</b>) of the Rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A newly added Rule is always <b>enabled</b>.</li>
 * <li>To check a Rule's state, use the {@link #isEnabled(String)} method.</li>
 * <li>To change a Rule's state, use the {@link #setEnabled(String, boolean)} method.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The {@link RuleRegistry} manages the status of the Rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li>To check a Rule's status info, use the {@link #getStatusInfo(String)} method.</li>
 * <li>The status of a Rule enabled with {@link #setEnabled(String, boolean)}, is first set to
 * {@link RuleStatus#UNINITIALIZED}.</li>
 * <li>After a Rule is enabled, a verification procedure is initiated. If the verification of the modules IDs,
 * connections between modules and configuration values of the modules is successful, and the module handlers are
 * correctly set, the status is set to {@link RuleStatus#IDLE}.</li>
 * <li>If some of the module handlers disappear, the Rule will become {@link RuleStatus#UNINITIALIZED} again.</li>
 * <li>If one of the Rule's Triggers is triggered, the Rule becomes {@link RuleStatus#RUNNING}.
 * When the execution is complete, it will become {@link RuleStatus#IDLE} again.</li>
 * <li>If a Rule is disabled with {@link #setEnabled(String, boolean)}, it's status is set to
 * {@link RuleStatus#DISABLED}.</li>
 * </ul>
