/**
 * This interface represents automation {@code Trigger} modules which define what phenomenon will start the execution
 * of the {@link Rule} and trigger it when an exact phenomenon occurs. Each of them can independently trigger the rule.
 * <p>
 * The triggers do not receive information from other modules of the Rule so they don't have {@link Input}s.
 * <p>
 * The triggers can be configured.
 * <p>
 * The triggers have {@link Output}s to provide information about the occurred phenomenon to the {@link Condition}s and
 * {@link Action}s of the Rule.
 * <p>
 * Building elements of conditions as {@link ConfigDescriptionParameter}s and {@link Input}s are defined by
 * {@link TriggerType}.
 * <p>
 * Trigger modules are placed in <b>triggers</b> section of the {@link Rule} definition.
