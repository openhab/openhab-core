/**
 * The {@link ProgressCallback} is injected into the
 * {@link FirmwareUpdateHandler#updateFirmware(Firmware, ProgressCallback)} operation in order to post progress
 * information about the firmware update process.
 *
 * The progress of a firmware update can be defined by a sequence of {@link ProgressStep}s, a percentage progress or
 * both.
 *
 * In order to use a sequence of {@link ProgressStep}s to indicate the update progress, it is necessary to first define
 * a sequence using the method {@link ProgressCallback#defineSequence(ProgressStep...)}. To indicate that the next
 * progress step is going to be executed the method {@link ProgressCallback#next()} has to be used.
 *
 * For updates which are based on a percentage progress it is optional to define a sequence of {@link ProgressStep}s and
 * to use the {@link ProgressCallback#next()} method. In order to indicate that the percentage progress has changed, the
 * method {@link ProgressCallback#update(progress)} has to be used. It allows to update the percentage progress to a
 * value between 0 and 100.
