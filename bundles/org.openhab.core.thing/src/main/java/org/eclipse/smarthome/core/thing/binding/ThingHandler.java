/**
 * A {@link ThingHandler} handles the communication between the openHAB framework and an entity from the real
 * world, e.g. a physical device, a web service, etc. represented by a {@link Thing}.
 * <p>
 * The communication is bidirectional. The framework informs a thing handler about commands, state and configuration
 * updates, and so on, by the corresponding handler methods. The handler can notify the framework about changes like
 * state and status updates, updates of the whole thing, by a {@link ThingHandlerCallback}.

 * @author Thomas Höfer - Added config description validation exception to handleConfigurationUpdate operation
