 * <li>extract certain informations from a weather forecast website</li>
 * <li>extract the status of your TV which provides it's status on a webpage</li>
 * <li>postprocess the output from a serial device to be human readable</li>
 * </ul>
 * One could provide his own processors by providing a new implementation of this
