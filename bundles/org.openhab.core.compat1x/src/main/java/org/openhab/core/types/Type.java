 * This is a parent interface for all states and commands.
 * It was introduced as many states can be commands at the same time and
 * vice versa. E.g a light can have the state ON or OFF and one can
 * also send ON and OFF as commands to the device. This duality is
 * captured by this marker interface and allows implementing classes
 * to be both state and command at the same time.
