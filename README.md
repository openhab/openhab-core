# openHAB 2 Core bundles

This project contains core bundles of the openHAB 2 runtime.

Building and running the project is fairly easy if you follow the steps detailed below.

Please note that openHAB 2 Core is not a product itself, but a framework to build solutions on top.
It is picked up by the main [openHAB distribution build](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro).

This means that what you build is primarily an artifact repository of OSGi bundles that can be used within smart home products.

1\. Prerequisites
=================

The build infrastructure is based on Maven. 
If you know Maven already then there won't be any surprises for you. 
If you have not worked with Maven yet, just follow the instructions and everything will miraculously work ;-)

What you need before you start:
- Maven3 from https://maven.apache.org/download.html

Make sure that the "mvn" command is available on your path

2\. Checkout
============

Checkout the source code from GitHub, e.g. by running

git clone https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core.git

3\. Building with Maven
=======================

To build this project from the sources, Maven takes care of everything:
- set MAVEN_OPTS to "-Xms512m -Xmx1024m"
- change into the openhab-core directory ("cd openhab-coreâ€œ)
- run "mvn clean install" to compile and package all sources

If there are tests that are failing occasionally on your local build, run `mvn -DskipTests=true clean install` instead to skip them.
